# Football Clubs

![Football Clubs Landing Page](/public/LandingPage.png)<br/>
About:This project uses  thesportsdb API. I created a small website to look up clubs, and information about each club by sending requests to this API. I used to react with some of its hooks to do this project, so make sure you download those files before running this App.

[Api list]:
List all Teams in a League:
https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/1/search_all_teams.php?s=Soccer&c=Spain
Team Details by Id:
https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/1/lookupteam.php?id=133604
